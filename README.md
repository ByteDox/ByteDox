# üëã Hey there, I'm Byte

I'm an aspiring full-stack developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and a touch of PHP. I enjoy building websites that I can eventually evolve into full software applications that have clean interfaces, smooth flows and code that is organised. I also enjoy that satisfaction of hunting down bugs and solving those frustrating problems that stop things from running properly

Right now, I'm working on a meal planning app called Xelos. It's a side project that‚Äôs slowly shaping into something I'm proud of. Alongside that, I'm a university student currently studying Information Technology, which is helping me fill the gaps, gain experience in different topics and sharpen my skills.

I'm always looking to improve, experiment and create things that people can use!

### üõ†Ô∏è Current Tools & Tech
These are the languages and tools I'm working with most often right now:
- Python - My go-to for building applications and messing around with ideas!
- HTML / CCS / JavaScript - For Shaping out responsive UIs and Code Validation.
- PHP - Just enough to make a database for Registers / Logins..
- VS Code - Where all the magic happens.
- Git & Github - Tracking progress and making history!

### üìö What I am learning
University covers a lot, but I'm also teaching myself things as I go along:
- Better UI/UX Design - Making sure apps run smoothly and look modern.
- Frontend Frameworks - Exploring React and others to build more up to date websites.
- Code Structure - Naming and organising complex code so it actually makes sense later on.

### üß© Stack Behind Xelos
Xelos is where I've been applying what I have learnt both in code and design. It's built using:
- Python - Handling user input and validation.
- Tkinter - Designing and refining the GUI for the application.
- Custom UI designs - Rounded, Floating panels that look slick and modern.
- Executable Packaging (PyInstaller) - Turning the project into a usable and clean application.
- Thoughtful, user focused planning - Every Decision is aimed to make the app more natural to use.

### üìå What's Next
I'm Planning to keep refining Xelos, explore different ways to make it even more user-friendly and hopefully getting it out there. I'm also diving deeper into front end frameworks, improving how I handle app structure and learning how to build things that feel like they were meant to be used.
